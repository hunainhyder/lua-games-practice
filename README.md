# 2D Games in Lua/Love2D
I was checking the Harvard University's GD50 course and decided to follow along.

It's a beginner level introduction to game development.

I am using this repo to store games I create along the way for submission.

List of all games are:
- Pong > In development
- Flappy Bird > In development

> [!NOTE]
