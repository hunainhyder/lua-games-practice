# 2D Games in Lua/Love2D
I was checking the Harvard University's GD50 course and decided to follow along.
It's a beginner level introduction to game development.
I am using this repo to store games I create along the way for submission.
I will be creating my own game assets once I finish the game programming part to learn about Game Art and Game Design.

List of all games are:
- Pong
- Flappy Bird

If you want to run these game just download the source code then,
```
cd [game-folder]
love .
```
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) installed first
